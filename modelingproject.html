     <h1>HIVE.</h1>
     <p class="desc">This was a study of the five human senses and the idea here is to combine and explore how these senses are cohesive with each other and define our humanity.
        I used crystals and metals to create an opposition to this to show the struggle between the organic and inorganic components of our lives.
        It is balanced and the composition is asymmetrical, this is done to reflect the delicately cohesive nature of the senses, our struggle between the organic and inorganic.
        Lighting throughout the piece makes the mood gloomy but also makes important aspects glow and stand out.</p>
