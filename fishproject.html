     <h1>FISH.</h1>
     <p class="desc">	For this project I had to find an algorithm and create something new with it. I selected the perlin noise algorithm. Using this original code I changed it to make the perlin noise waves reflect each other and converted the wave into it's own class. This class accepts multiple variables that allows me to change the location and variations within the wave so I can create multiple different waves with ease. As the framecount increases, more waves are added, creating a layered effect. For a visual affect, I created a bubble class that allows for fish to be added to the scene, and with each added wave, three more fish appear as well.  </p>
