     <h1>ABOUT</h1>
     <p class="about">My name is Ankita and I am a Digital Media Artist. This is my current portfolio.

My goal with my art is to create works that people can feel they are a part of. As someone who is passionate about both art and storytelling, I hope to make games that are visual narratives for people to enjoy and immerse themselves in. While I can appreciate all forms of art, I want to be involved in art where I feel that others can in some way leave their mark as well. Using technology to enhance and improve upon my art is something that I love exploring and learning about. Using technology allows me to make art that is responsive and this caters well towards my creative goals.</p>
